{Hamiltonian and integrable systems}
{Organizers: B. Feng \& T. Ohsawa}
{Many mathematical models arising from physics and engineering are Hamiltonian systems, and in some special cases, also integrable systems as well. These systems can be studied by analytical, algebraic, and geometric approaches. The purpose of this minisymposium is to bring a group of researchers of Hamiltonian and integrable systems with diverse backgrounds to present their recent findings and exchange ideas for further developments.}
