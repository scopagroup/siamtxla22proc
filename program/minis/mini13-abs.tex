{Numerical methods and applications for geosciences}
{Organizers: G. S. Jones \& L. Cappanera}
{Computational geosciences often involve complex nonlinear models that couple different physical processes. The study of such problems requires the development of robust and efficient numerical algorithms for high performance computing. In this mini symposium, we focus on numerical methods applied to phenomena arising in geosciences such as reservoir simulation, multiphase flow, water waves, etc. Speakers will present their recent research developments and applications in computational geosciences which includes numerical modeling, numerical analysis, and other computational aspects.}
