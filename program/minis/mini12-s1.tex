{Tensor modeling and applications}
{Organizers: Y. Lou \& S. Minkoff}
{In many data-driven applications, high-dimensional data can be naturally represented by a tensor. Tensor-based methodologies ranging from modeling to optimization have received tremendous attention.  This mini-symposium will feature talks on tensor algebra, representation theories, and optimization algorithms together with their applications. The aim is to provide a platform to exchange ideas across disciplines and encourage collaborations.}
