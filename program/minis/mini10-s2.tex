{High-order numerical methods for partial differential equations}
{Organizers: J. Huang \& Z. Sun}
{High order numerical methods have been continuously receiving intensive attentions for solving partial differential equations. They are typically able to better resolve solutions with overall fewer computational resources. The goal of the special session is to gather researchers in this area and to discuss the recent advances in the development of high order methods. Topics may cover but are not limited to numerical analysis of high order methods, techniques for enhancing robustness and efficiency of numerical schemes, and development of structure-preserving high order methods for physical models.}
