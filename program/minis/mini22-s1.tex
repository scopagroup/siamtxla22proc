{Stability of Solitary Waves with applications to Optics and Fluids}
{Organizers: Brian Choi \& Ross Parker }
{This minisymposium presents recent advances in the stability of solitary waves motivated from nonlinear wave phenomena. Solitary waves are localized disturbances in a medium that propagate with a constant velocity. Nonlinear wave equations often exhibit solitary wave solutions whose stability properties are of interest for both mathematical and physical reasons. This session highlights these stability features via analytic and numerical approaches, featuring the fourth-order nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation, and the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.}
