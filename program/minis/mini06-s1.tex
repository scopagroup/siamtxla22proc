{Physics-based and data-driven models for engineering applications}
{Organizers: M. Tyagi \& Y. Akkutlu}
{This mini-symposium will cover a wide range of engineering applications using physics-based simulations as well as data-driven machine learning models. Presentation examples would range from subsurface flow phenomena, fluid dynamics, and mathematical foundations of data-science. The proposed mini symposium would also bring together interdisciplinary researchers working on highly relevant societal challenges through their understanding of different aspects of underlying physics and data-driven models.}
