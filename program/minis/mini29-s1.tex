{Applications and Computation in Algebraic Geometry}
{Organizers: Jordy Lopez Garcia, Josu\'e Tonelli-Cueto \& Thomas Yahl}
{Many applied problems, such as the description of the position of a robotic arm or the equilibria points of a biochemical reaction network, can be formulated in terms of polynomials. Therefore, to deepen our understanding of these problems, we need to develop computational methods that exploit the appearing algebraic and geometric structures. In this mini-symposium, we gather researchers working at the intersection of algebraic geometry, computation, and applications.}
