{Special Topics in Mathematical Biology}
{Organizers: Summer Atkins \& Hayriye Gulbudak}
{The aim of this session is to provide an opportunity for researchers to meet and discuss recent advances in mathematical biology. Such advances can be new biological findings obtained through the use of tools from the mathematical sciences or  new mathematical ideas and methods that have direct applications to biological investigations. Topics include but are not limited to population dynamics, deterministic or stochastic modeling, optimal control theory, network modeling, and statistical analysis.}
