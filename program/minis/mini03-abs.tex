{Mathematical modeling for biological dynamics}
{Organizers: Z. Qu,	L. Asik \& X.-S. Wang}
{Mathematical models are powerful tools for understanding and informing complex biological phenomena. In recent years, there has been broad interest in applying mathematics to study a variety of biological fields, such as epidemiology, ecology, and neurology. Mathematical models at different spatial and temporal scales have been developed to focus on population-level dynamics, within-host processes, as well as multiscale dynamics that span several biological scales and capture the feedback between them. The utility of the proposed models requires a solid model formulation from realistic biological phenomena, rigorous analysis using mathematical theories, and accurately solved by numerical methods. This mini-symposium will highlight the new developments in these areas and bring together researchers who work on various models for biological systems from the perspectives of modeling, analysis, and computation. It will serve as a platform to present recent progress, exchange research ideas, extend academic networks, and seek future cooperation.}
