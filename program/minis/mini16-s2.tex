{Recent Advances in Reduced Order Models}
{Organizers: Matthias Heinkenschloss}
{The speakers in this minisymposium present recent advances in the construction, analysis, and application of projection-based reduced order models. Projection-based reduced order models (PROMs) are small-dimensional, computational efficient, accurate models obtained by systematically extracting the relevant dynamics of large-scale systems. PROMs are crucial in many query applications, such as uncertainty quantification, optimal control or parameter identification, where they replace the prohibitively expensive large-scale models. The talks in the minisymposium present recent advances the construction of data-driven, non-intrusive PROMs, modifications of PROMs that preserve structure of the underlying large-scale full order models, and applications of PROMs in large-scale optimization and parameter identification.}
