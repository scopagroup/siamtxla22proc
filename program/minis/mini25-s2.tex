{High Order Methods for Computational Hydrodynamics}
{Organizers: Madison Sheridan \& Bennett Clayton}
{The construction of accurate numerical methods is essential for simulating transport phenomena in the field of computational hydrodynamics. The aim of this mini-symposium is to discuss the current state of higher-order accurate methods for simulating realistic hydrodynamics. In particular, we are interested in numerical methods that are higher-order accurate in space and time while maintaining structure preserving properties. The partial differential equations we have in mind are those with dominant hyperbolic features such as: (i) the compressible Euler Equations; (ii) the Shallow Water Equations; (iii) the compressible Navier-Stokes Equations; (iv) radiation transport equations such as the Boltzmann Equation. These equations are often strongly nonlinear and pose numerous challenges when one tries to discretize and solve them numerically.}
