{Recent Advances of Numerical Simulations for Fluid Flows and Applications}
{Organizers: Yong Yang \& Yonghua Yan}
{Numerical simulations have become vital research tools in fluid flows. This mini-symposium is dedicated to recent developments of numerical simulations for fluid flows and applications. All numerical methods including the finite difference method, the finite volume method, the finite element method, and the lattice Boltzmann method are welcome.}
