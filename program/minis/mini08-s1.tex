{Sparse representation and model reduction for scientific problems}
{Organizers: Y. Lou, J. Hu \& Y. Yang}
{Many scientific problems involve predictive models of multi-scale and multi-physics systems, most of which are extremely complex and computationally expensive to simulate. Yet, a common feature of these problems is that there is often an underlying sparse or reduced representation which can greatly ease the heavy computation burden. This mini-symposium will bring researchers working on these relevant regimes to exchange ideas and encourage collaborations.}
