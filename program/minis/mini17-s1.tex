{Recent Advances in Learning}
{Organizers: Andrea Bonito \& Ming Zhong}
{We gather a group of speakers to present recent development and challenges in learning, in terms of both mathematical and computational aspects of discovering model questions, physical quantities, parametric structures, surrogate models, etc., from observation data. }
{Location: CBB 110}
