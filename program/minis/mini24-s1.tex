{Nonlinear Physics Models and Mathematical Structures}
{Organizers: Vesselin Vatchev, Zhijun Qiao, Wilson Zuniga Galindo \& Erwin Suazo}
{The aim of the mini symposium is participants to present talks and engage in a discussion of a variety of recent work and results in the area of Nonlinear Physics. The emphasis is on nonlinear PDE’s, properties of their solutions, and theoretical or numerical methods for solving them with direct application to Physics Models. Topics of interest are developing models, numerical solutions and methods designed to better capture Physical characteristics of PDE’s, and in more general terms providing mathematical structures to describe Physics phenomenon.}
