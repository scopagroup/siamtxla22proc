{Nonlocal models in mathematics and computation}
{Organizers: P. Diehl, D. Bhattacharya, B. Aksoylu \& R. Lipton}
{Nonlocal models have drawn increasing interest from both the mathematical and computational science communities in recent years. This is due to their ability to describe physical processes which lie outside classical local theories. Over the last fifteen years, mathematicians have begun to identify the mathematical theory behind these approaches. These efforts complement the advances in model development, computational methods and experiments necessary to validate nonlocal modeling. The objective of this mini-symposia is to bring together experts in nonlocal models from mathematics, computational science, and mechanics, in order to further the dialogue between these communities.}
