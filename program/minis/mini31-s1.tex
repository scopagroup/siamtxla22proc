{Mathematical modeling and robust numerical algorithmsin various biological processes}
{Organizers: Shuang Liu}
{Computational and mathematical biology are important new areas in the biological sciences. Recognizing this, I propose a miniâ€“symposium on the topic of computational and mathematical biology entitled mathematical modeling and robust numerical algorithms in various biological processes,which aims to bring the attention of researchers to the broad biological research area and at the same time focuses on a few specific subjects: the growth of brain tumor, cell polarization, cell movement, cell migration, and patterning and tissue formation within the body.Various efficient computational tools and robust numerical algorithms, like powerful machine learning methodologies, phase-field method, and level-set method, have enabled the capability of capturing complicated dynamics in various biological processes.The mini-symposium session consists of 4 invited talks, which are from the perspective of developing mathematical models of complex biological processes, as well as capturing complicated mechanisms with extensive numerical and computational simulations.}
